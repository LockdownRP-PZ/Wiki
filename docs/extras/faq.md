# Frequently Asked Questions
---

## How long does it take for my application to be accepted/denied?

?> Applications can sometimes take up to 3-4 days to be accepted. This is because the Application process goes through a
scrutinous process in order the get the best level of Character Design and RP from players. Application Handlers are
also (like all members of Staff) volunteers and therefore personal circumstances mean applications may take longer than
normal to be processed.

## Is VC (Voice Chat) allowed?

?> Lockdown is a text-based ONLY Roleplay Server. Whilst there are indeed VC channels, the use of VC to roleplay with
other players whilst playing on the server is not allowed. Feel free to use the VC channels to chit-chat, chill, share
music and watch videos/films.

## Is 'grinding' allowed?.

*(= When a player focuses solely on a certain skill to get it maxed as soon as possible)*

?> At Lockdown, we promote Realistic Roleplay. (psst, it's even one of our Rules!) And we discourage 'grinding'.

## What if a player really upsets me or is offensive?

?> Please do not suffer any sort of bullying or harrasment in silence. Members of Staff are here to help - so please
feel free to open a Support ticket and explain the situation you feel you are in. If you encounter problems with a
member of Staff, please contact an admin or community manager directly.

## What if an In-Character (IC) situation upsets me or does not go the way I wanted?

?> Firstly, take a good look at our Server Guides channel. Specifically, 'Bleed and How to Avoid it' and 'Accepting
Character Death'. These guides are written by Players, for the Players - and they come from experience and meaning.
Secondly, please remember that Lockdown RP is just a game and the players behind the characters you meet are real
people, just like you. Finally, Roleplaying is a dynamic, organic and unpredictable - so what happens can be (and
sometimes will be) out of your hands. Roll with the punches.
