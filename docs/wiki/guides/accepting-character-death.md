## Death.

We all know how easy it is to become attached to our characters. They are our creations and they tell the stories we
want to tell. Yet, on this server, death is a common occurrence. The situations our characters find themselves in are
unbelievably dangerous, and death plays a significant role.

**How does one deal with a character death?**

*There are many reasons why a character's story might end prematurely, and it happens more often than some might think.
Different players have different approaches to handling this issue. Here are a few common approaches:*

- **Taking a Break**: When a beloved character's story ends prematurely, it can be emotionally exhausting. The weight of
  such a loss can impact the desire to start over. Some players find it helpful to take a break. This is perfectly
  normal and nothing to be ashamed of. Breaks during a season, especially after the emotional impact of an unfinished
  story, are valid and can provide the necessary time to recharge.

- **Having Backup Characters**: Some players keep backup characters. These may not be fully formed but have a rough
  outline of what they seek in an RP scenario. Having one or two backup characters ready can help mitigate the feelings
  of loss when a premature death occurs. It reduces the feelings of starting from scratch since you already have a
  general idea prepared.

- **Powering Through**: Other players adopt a more unorthodox approach, throwing their characters into the server like a
  meat grinder, waiting for something to stick. While this might seem like a fearless way to play, it has its downsides.
  Characters created this way might not be fully thought out and may need deeper development in-game. However, this is a
  valid method of play and can lead to some surprising and engaging stories.

**What should you do?**

Deciding how to cope with a character's death is a personal choice. None of the points outlined are strict rules on how
to cope with the end of a not fully developed story. Ultimately, the right way to deal with character death is the way
that feels right for you. Each player has their own method of coping, and whatever you choose, remember that it's okay.
Your experience and enjoyment on the server is what matter most.
