## What is Bleed? ü©∏

If something that happened Out Of Character (OOC) affects your experience IC (In Character), or something happens IC
that affects you OOC, that is ***Bleed***! It references the 'bleeding' between the line of what is happening in
roleplay and what is happening in real life. It happens to everyone, and it's important to recognize when it's
happening, and how to handle it.

This article references NEGATIVE Bleed. Bleed can be positive, but negative Bleeding refers to how negative emotions can
affect everyone's ability to roleplay in a safe environment together.

**Examples of Bleed**

- Your character is betrayed IC, and you OOC feel betrayed.
- You OOC feel possessive over the relationship, or outcome of another person's character due to the IC relationship
  they have with your character.
- You were treated poorly at work, or school OOC and so your character is uncharacteristically hostile or depressive in
  a way that they typically would not be.
- Other characters are opinionated about your character in a negative way, and you begin to feel defensive OOC about
  your character's choices.
- Becoming frustrated with someone OOC when their roleplay character has controversial opinions, or actions that you do
  not agree with morally.
- Making passive-aggressive or guilt-tripping comments toward other members, or their characters not engaging IC with
  your character in a way that you would like.
- Ect.

## How to avoid or minimize Bleed?

- **Remember that IC is IC**
  What is played out IC is entirely IC, and does not nor *should not* reflect the 'true feelings' or 'motives' of the
  writer OOC. We are collectively writing a fictional story together, and when something happens in character, remember
  that's all it is: In Character.

- **Keep it IC**
  Making new friends that can connect with each other through this niche and shared hobby of RP is wonderful, and can
  even be life-long. Sometimes, however, over-sharing in your ideas for your character, or pre-planning too much story
  OOC with your friends can cause Bleed when plans change, or some things do not happen as intended. It may be better to
  keep OOC pre-planning with others to a minimum to allow for improvision, and changes in the long haul. Surprises are
  fun, anyway!

- **Take a break**
  If you start to feel strained, or irritated, take a break! Go for a walk, drink some water, stretch, spend some time
  with friends unrelated to your roleplay hobby, or relax with family, and pets. This can help re-center your
  perspective on something that happened IC or OOC that you may feel is more important than it should be.

- **Expect the unexpected**
  Getting attached to our characters and narrative is a natural part of roleplay, and an indication that the story is
  getting really good! However, try to avoid planning too far ahead, and don't expect things to always go the way you
  intend for them to. Remember this story is being written by many people, and surprise endings are often the most fun!

- **Separate yourself from your character**
  We all put a little bit of ourselves in our characters. Channeling our personal experiences can make roleplay feel
  more immersive, but it's important to remain an actor portraying a character, and not an actor playing a version of
  yourself. Putting too much of 'you' into a character is a recipe for hurt feelings, strong attachment, and scenarios
  that may feel 'too close to home.'

- **Be self-aware**
  Try to be self-aware and analyze your character's actions and choices by asking yourself if it makes sense for your
  character to do these things, or are their actions being driven by your negative OOC emotions? This applies to how you
  interact with everyone OOC as well.

## How to recover from Bleed?

Experiencing Bleed is normal! Everyone puts a lot of thought, emotion, personal experience, and investment into their
characters. Frustration, anxiety, and attachments can be the product of good storytelling, but the severity and your
ability to manage these feelings in a healthy way is what potentially makes Bleeding toxic to you, and the people around
you. Set boundaries as you need them, and discuss them OOC with those it may affect. You may even need to change how you
play your character - and that's fine! It is most important that you, the player, are happy and healthy.

Reach out to your friends or even Lockdown RP support staff if you feel like you may be experiencing Bleed. We want to
ensure that our community is having fun and feeling safe. ‚ù§Ô∏è
