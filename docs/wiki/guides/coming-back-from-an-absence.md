## Coming Back From An Absence

Things happen. We can't always be available or present for events, and IRL is always more important. You don’t always
have to explain where or why a character was gone, but if you feel lost coming back from an absence or hiatus, here’s
some RP-friendly reasons that your character was gone.

- **”Offscreen”** can be used to describe what your character has been doing while you’re not playing them. While events
  happen “on-screen”, your character could be doing other things.

- **SurvivorJournals** are a great way to explain what your character has been up to off-screen.

🧭 Lost while traveling
> Your character could have gotten lost. Their map could have gotten destroyed or they got off-track. They only recently
> found their way back home.

👪 Family business
> Your character could have family somewhere. They left on a short trip to see if they were still alive, and returned
> with good or bad news.

🕵️ Kidnapped/Mugged
> Your character could have been taken against their will. If there are looters or bandits, perhaps their things were
> stolen and the character was dumped somewhere after.

🚙 Car trouble
> If your character uses a vehicle, its engine could have had trouble while they were on a long trip. It could have
> taken your character a long time to find help or pieces to fix the vehicle and get back home safely.

🤒 Nasty cold
> Your character had an illness. They decided to stay home for a while for their symptoms and to not get others sick.
