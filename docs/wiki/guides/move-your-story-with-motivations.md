# Move Your Story With Motivations

*A basic guide and brainstorming list for character goals and motivations, by **purplegiraffes***

## What does your character want?

- 🔥   **Motivation.**  It's the spark a good story needs. Having an intrinsic goal or motivation for your character to
  work toward can give them direction. They can be big or small, one or many. You can start your character with their
  goal in mind, or find them along the way!

- 🧗   **Why is a motivation important?**  Because it gives your character’s story momentum. It can drive them to step
  out of their comfort zone, confront a fear, or make a friend. What is it your character wants? And, what are they
  willing to do to achieve it? Without risk, there’s no reward— likewise, if your character doesn’t have a goal to
  achieve, there is no reward to take a risk for. A character without motivation stagnates.

- 🧭    **Motivations can change,** especially if your character’s circumstances change— so don’t feel trapped with a
  goal if you feel it doesn’t fit your character anymore or isn’t fun to pursue. It can be part of long-term character
  development for goals to change, or as abrupt as an overnight wake-up call.

- 🤝   **Goals can help build connections** by bringing characters together or pitting them against each other. Consider
  how your character’s motivation can play off other characters.

- 🗺️    **Sometimes, no motivation can be its own motivation.** If your character doesn’t have any motive, finding a
  goal to pursue could very well be one!

If you need some ideas to fuel your gas-tank, here is a list of them!

**Altruism**
*First-responders, Volunteers, Good Samaritans*
> The drive to help others can be a powerful one. Your character could have a goal to protect or help those around them,
> either friends or strangers. They could have participated at the local soup kitchen or looked up to someone who helped
> others.

**Belief**
*Church Potluckers, The God-fearing, The Spiritual*
> Your character believes in some higher power, and their goals are based on this. They could aim to protect locations
> important to their faith or spread their faith's teachings. Perhaps they lost their faith, and want to regain it.

**Bonvivant**
*Socialites, Gourmet Chefs, Travelers*
> The finer things in life motivate your character. The best wines, the finest foods, fanciest apartments, or luxury
> soirées, are things your character could strive for. Maybe they're high maintenance, or maybe they just want what they
> could have before. Whatever the reason, they're always looking for the next lavish thing, and bonus points if they get
> to show it off!

**Collection**
*Enthusiasts, Hobbyists, Magpies*
> Your character collects something to an unreasonable degree of pursuit. It could be comic books, different models of
> toy cars, or bugs for a terrarium. Whatever it is, they have a vested interest in obtaining them. The more strange or
> unique, the better.

**Competition**
*Athletes, Perfectionists, Entrepreneurs*
> Your character has a feud with a group or person. They want to be the best, or could have such a long-standing rivalry
> that they can’t remember what started it. Whatever the reason, they want to be better and won’t stop until they’ve
> beaten their competitors.

**Creativity**
*Tortured Artists, Novelists, Song-writers*
> Your character is motivated by art. They might have goals of finding the perfect muse or creating a masterpiece that
> will stand the test of time. Perhaps your character has burnout with their work and is searching to revive that spark.
** **

**Desperation**
*Petty Criminals, The Destitute, Caffeine-addicts*
> Your character could be without a necessity, giving them a goal to pursue- whether it be money, shelter, or something
> as simple as coffee. Whatever it is, it’s an issue for them and something to pursue.

**Destruction**
*Bullies, Arsonists, Troublemakers*
> Maybe it’s your character’s way of getting people’s attention, or perhaps they just want to watch the world burn.
> Whatever the reason, your character has a goal of destruction. Pranks, vandalism, and breaking the law are on their
> to-do list. Be warned, they just might get their comeuppance.

**Discovery**
*Scientists, Professors, Conspiracy-theorists*
> The world around your character is a curious one to explore. Your character could have aspirations to discover the
> undiscovered or become the next major name in textbooks with their research.

**Envy**
*Runner-ups, Critics, Homewreckers*
> Your character wants something that someone else has so, so badly. Their want is so powerful that it drives them in
> everything they do. Anything - or anyone - in the way should beware.

**Escape**
*Con-Artists, Runaways, Fugitives*
> Someone or something is chasing your character. Whether it’s the law or a dark past, they’re trying to escape it.
> Goals could include blending in, hiding secrets, or finding a safe refuge somewhere that people will accept them.

**Justice**
*Vigilantes, Police, Lawyers*
> Some may want to bring wrong-doers to justice… or their brand of Justice. They could have been part of a neighborhood
> watch, or care for the community. Your character could want to uphold the law or a moral ideology.

**Land**
*Farm-owners, Landlords, Heirs*
> Your character could have motivations tied to a location or plot of land. Maintaining, defending, or obtaining that
> land could be potential goals. Maybe your character wants renters, or maybe they want to keep out trespassers.
> Whatever
> it is, the location is important.
** **

**Rebellion**
*Anarchists, Idealists, Advocates*
> Is there a cause or movement your character might support? It could be anything from protecting the wilderness to
> challenging authority. Pick something in the world your character wants to change or combat and go for it- who knows,
> others might join your crusade.

**Redemption**
*Traitors, Ex-convicts, Deadbeats*
> Redeeming a character can be a fun goal to pursue. Perhaps your character wronged someone once or owes a debt, and now
> wants to make up for it.

**Revenge**
*The Betrayed, Scapegoats, Widows*
> If your character or someone they care about was hurt by someone, it could provide a goal to pursue— revenge. It
> doesn’t have to mean death, but it could mean a series of nasty pranks or sabotage.

**Revelry**
*DJs, Clubbers, Frat-boys*
> The party-life can be a motivation for your character, especially if they’re extroverted. Whether it’s dancing,
> talking, or the loud music, your character enjoys a good party and builds goals around this motivation, such as making
> a
> network of party-friends.

**Thrill-seeking**
*Stuntmen, Base-jumpers, Cat-burglars*
> Your character lives for the thrill. Whatever risk gets their heart pumping becomes a goal, whether it’s breaking a
> record, risking danger, or testing their limits. They want to see how far they can get before they push their luck
> over
> the edge. Adrenaline Junkie goes well with this goal!

**Truth**
*Journalists, Private Investigators, Forensic Scientists*
> A blend of discovery and justice, unveiling secrets could be a motivation for your character. When there are scandals,
> corruption, or lies, your character feels a sense of duty to bring the truth to light. It’s time to snoop and
> eavesdrop.
