# Getting Started

Welcome to Lockdown RP! This guide will help you get started with the basics of the server.

## Discord Introduction

If you haven't yet, you should join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/AyhJfGUGfU)! This is where you can find
all the latest news and updates about the server, apply for a character, and chat with other players. Discord server
membership is a requirement to play on the server.

When you first join the Discord server, you might be confused about how to get started. The 
[Lockdown RP](https://discord.com/channels/929553323613368413/929557313264713749) channel outlines some of the basics of
the server, and should guide you in the right direction. After you have read through our [rules](/rules/rules), as well
as some of the other guides in this section, you should be ready to apply for server membership and a character over at
the [Apply Here](https://discord.com/channels/929553323613368413/929559372273692712) channel!

For questions, you can always ping our **Roleplay Mentor** role in the
[Roleplay Help](https://discord.com/channels/929553323613368413/1035339755300331570) channel. Our mentors are here to
help you with any questions you might have about the server, roleplay, character development, and more.

## Server Connection

Our server information is available in the [Lockdown RP](https://discord.com/channels/929553323613368413/929557313264713749)
channel on Discord. You can find the server IP address here. Your login credentials are provided by our custom Corvus
bot, which will send you a DM after your character application has been approved.

Upon joining, you will be prompted to subscribe to the server's mods. Keep in mind this might take a little while, 
especially on slower connections. Once this is done, you will be able to play!
