## Buffy's Roleplay Chat ðŸ’¬

Lockdown RP utilizes [Buffy's Roleplay Chat](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2688851521) mod.
These chat commands make narrating your character's actions cohesive and immersive, and **we require players to use it
when describing their actions. **

It includes a range-based chat system, a language system, and many RP commands for different formatting. These functions
can be accessed through a cogwheel menu on the top right of the chat box. It includes other useful roleplay tools, such
as cleaning blood off of your character, changing your hair color to any RGB value, growing out your hair, and for those
who can grow beards, the option to grow one out instantly. You can also access learned languages in the 'Language'
section of the cogwheel menu. Clicking your desired language will have you speaking in it by default.

This guide will hopefully help explain some of the quality features you can use with this mod.

## Changing Your Character's Name Color ðŸŽ¨

By utilizing [RGB value codes](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html), this mod allows you to customize
your character's name color in-game where it will be displayed publicly for everyone to see.

Choosing a color to display as your character's name is an easy way to represent your character's personality, and
looks. While picking a color for your character's name is not required, we recommend it as a way to make your text more
easily identifiable from someone else's. Try to be mindful of what is visible in the chat box before selecting your
color.

Select the cogwheel at the top right of your chat box to find Buffy's customizing options.

## Changing your character's Name ðŸ” 

You can change your character's name by typing `/name` in the chat box, and then typing out the desired name.

This feature is sometimes used to change a character's identity, or to represent a more desirable nickname.

## Changing your Character's Appearance ðŸ’„

You may utilize [RGB value codes](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html) to change your character's hair
color, and also force your character to instantly grow hair. **Please be mindful of realism**. If your character has
short hair, it should take several in-game months before it can be considered long.

Additionally, you can automatically clean your character of visible grime with the **Clean Blood & Dirt** option. Not
that it does not clean your character's clothes.

## Using Chat Commands

- `/yell` - This utilizes regular speech, but implies that your character is either speaking very loudly, or shouting.
  It will be heard in a large radius. Additionally, **this command does not attract zombies like pressing 'q' does**.
- `/low` - This utilizes regular speech, but implies your character is speaking quietly. The radius of this text is
  smaller than normal.
- `/whisper` - This utilizes regular speech, but implies your character is whispering. The radius of this text is
  significantly smaller, and only characters directly adjacent to you can see, or hear it.

- `/me` - This begins your text with your character's name. /me can be used to describe something your character is
  doing. Using "quotations" will isolate what your character is saying inside the `/me` text.
- `/melong` - The text is seen in a wider radius, and can be used to ensure someone a further distance sees it, or that
  the action may be louder than normal.
- `/melow` - The text is seen in a smaller radius, and can be used to imply your character's actions are quieter than
  normal.
- `/whisperme` - This text is seen in a significantly smaller radius, and implies that only character's directly
  adjacent to yours can see, or hear it.

*Example:*

```
/me leans against the wall, and fidgets with his lighter. Chk, chk, chk, it sounds, as the spark wheel is rolled with his thumb until it ignites the flame. He cradles the delicate fire with his palm as he lights the tip of a slightly bent cigarette between his lips. With heavy eyes, he gazes toward Aoife who approaches.
```

```
/melow removes the lit cigarette from his mouth as he pockets his lighter. "Do you need something?" He asks quietly.
```

- `/do` - The text begins without your character's name. `/do` can be used to describe ambience, or describe your
  character's actions.
- `/dolong` - This can be used to describe ambience that can be seen in a large radius.
- `/dolow` - Similarly, this can be used to describe ambience that can be seen in a smaller radius.

*Example: *

```
/dolong The aurora dances across the night sky like a celestial ballet, with ribbons made of green, pink and violet. It's as if the heavens unfurled a shimmering tapestry just for them, leaving Esther in awe, and Chip speechless.
```

## Buffetta's Language Books ðŸ“”


By reading a Language Book, you will have access to that language through the Language Menu option by selecting the
cogwheel on the top right of your chat window.

**You can request a language book by opening
a [lore ticket](https://discord.com/channels/929553323613368413/1142496242757283910).**

You must have established in your character's application that they know these languages beforehand, or have evidence of
on-going roleplay where your character is being taught a language by another character that is fluent.

By default, all characters know English. Selecting a different language will prevent players who do not also know that
language from seeing what you say.

Languages available through Buffetta's Language Books are
`American Sign Language, French, German, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian.`
