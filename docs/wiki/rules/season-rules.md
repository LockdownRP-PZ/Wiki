# Season 2 Rules

## Pre-Apocalypse Phase Rules 📖

These rules are temporary and will be removed once there is an official announcement of when the outbreak has begun.

### Looting 🏘️

No looting empty properties. There are implied citizens living inside those homes, and it is strictly prohibited to steal from them until after the outbreak.

### Criminal Activity 🦹

Normal stealing rules apply when stealing from safehouses. Please read our rules before stealing. 

- Stealing from non-occupied shops that utilize Ration Cards as currency is strictly prohibited.
- Stealing from player-owned businesses must be done through roleplay, and when the shop owner is online.
- Mugging, Assault, Murder, etc., must utilize text-PvP rules. Please read our rules on text-PvP.

### Leveling 🆙

This pre-apocalypse period is primarily meant for roleplay. XP rates will reflect this, and out-of-character level grinding that does not suit your character's chosen profession is prohibited, and will be met with moderation action.

Example: A baker with no knowledge of the outbreak would not reload a firearm for several hours a day. A carpenter would not level the entire town of its trees so he may build an extension to his house. Any person would know that doing squats for 24 hours a day would destroy their body.

Players found power-leveling may be subject to a 24-hour ban.

### Communication 📻

Use the ic-sms-texting channel for in-character communication on Discord. Follow the post guidelines in the channel.

(May propose an ic-social-media forum)

### Grace Period 👼

The whole pre-outbreak period counts as a grace period. 
You get one grace revive during the pre-outbreak.
Once the outbreak starts, the 3-in-game-day grace period starts.

### Item acquisition 🛍️

Do not loot the area. 
To acquire items such as food, meds, clothing, books, tools, etc., buy them from stores using your Ration Card or trade with a player-owned business.

Your character is not aware of the impending apocalypse. Purchase reasonably for your character's backstory.

There are a limited amount of items that will be stocked in these stores, and this is done purposefully. More items may arrive throughout the duration of the pre-outbreak. Some items may never arrive. If you need a hammer; ask your neighbor.

### Ration Cards 💳

Items have been rationed to Redford County. You may take up to 4 encumbrance worth of items from each store in Mapleton each in-game day. 

You may take up to 8 encumbrance total across all stores each in-game day. 

This means you can, for example, on a given day, take 5 cans of food (.8 encumbrance each) from one store, and 2 pairs of pants (2 encumbrance each) from another.

We know when you do not follow this rule. We're watching you. 👀

### Player-owned Businesses 🫵

Player-owned businesses can only be shopped at when the owner is online and attending their shop. 
The owner may choose to trade, imply payment transaction, or give-away their items however they would like.
Normal safehouse rules apply to player-owned businesses.

## Scrapyard Rules

Welcome to the Scrapyard. (Season 2's Scrapyard is on La Cour Rd, indicated on the labeled map we've provided) Help yourself to the junk inside. Scrap it, salvage it, take out your anger on it, whatever. We only ask that you donate some of your own resources in return. The more you give, the more we'll have, which means we can bring in better and more junk. We hope this will be a beneficial arrangement for all.

In the Scrapyard, there will be multiple cars of varying states of decay. THEY ARE NOT CLAIMABLE AS VEHICLES. The cars in the Scrapyard are solely for training mechanics, dismantling, and scavenging parts.

- Be Courteous! Do not dismantle every car in the lot by yourself. Let other people have a chance to get at the parts they need or train what they need.
- Use Common Sense
  > If a vehicle has many good parts, consider uninstalling them before dismantling a vehicle or not dismantling it. While there are not rules on when and when not to dismantle in the Scrapyard, this falls under the 'Be Courteous' category.

If there are questions, please reach out to staff! Staff will be checking in on the area to make sure it's being used properly. We also will be refreshing the vehicles from time to time in order to allow rotating stock of parts and inventory.
