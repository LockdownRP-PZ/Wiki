# Season 2 Rules

## Pre-Apocalypse Rules

*These rules are temporary and will be removed once there is an official announcement of when the outbreak has begun.*

### Looting

- No looting empty properties. There are implied citizens living inside those homes, and it is strictly prohibited to steal from them until after the outbreak.

### Criminal Activity

- Normal theft rules apply when stealing from safehouses. Review rule #3 before stealing from other players. ðŸ“•[server-rules](link-to-server-rules)
- Stealing from non-occupied shops that utilize ER Cards as currency is strictly prohibited.
- Stealing from player-owned businesses must be done following our theft rules.
- Mugging, Assault, Murder, etc., must utilize PvP or text-based PvP rules. Review rule #4 for more information.

### Leveling

- This pre-apocalypse period is primarily meant for roleplay. XP rates will reflect this, and out-of-character level grinding that does not suit your character's chosen profession or has been prompted organically through RP is prohibited and will be met with moderation action.
- Players found power-leveling may be subject to a 24-hour ban.

### Communication

- Use the ic-sms-texting channel for in-character communication on Discord. Follow the post guidelines in the channel.

### Grace Period

- The whole pre-outbreak period counts as a grace period.
- You get one grace revive during the pre-outbreak.
- Once the outbreak starts, the 3-in-game-day grace period starts.

### Item Acquisition

- Do not loot the area.
- To acquire items such as food, meds, clothing, books, tools, etc., buy them from stores using your ER Card or trade with a player-owned business.
- Your character is not aware of the impending apocalypse. Purchase reasonably for your character's backstory.
- There are a limited amount of items that will be stocked in these stores, and this is done purposefully. More items may arrive throughout the duration of the pre-outbreak. Some items may never arrive. If you need a hammer; ask your neighbor.

### ER Cards

- You may take up to 4 encumbrance worth of items from each store in Mapleton each in-game day.
- You may take up to 6 encumbrance total across all stores each in-game day.
- The exception is if there is 1 item above 4 encumbrance which will count for your whole day's worth of items.

For example:
- Oct 2nd - You bought 5 cans of food (.8 encumbrance ea) from the Food market, and 1 pair of pants (2 encumbrance) from the Clothing store. You have reached your limit.
- Oct 3rd - You bought 1 Barbeque from the Tool Store (10 encumbrance). You have reached your limit.
- Oct 4th - You bought 1 sack of flour(1) Butter (.3), Bottle of Wine (1) from the Food Market, A Cherry Spiffo from the Pawn Shop (.2), and 1 Alkagine Pack (0.5) from the Family Clinic. You have 1 encumbrance left to spend today.

### Player-owned Businesses

- Player-owned businesses can only be shopped at when the owner is online and attending their shop.
- The owner may choose to trade, imply payment transaction, or give away their items however they would like.
- Normal safehouse rules apply to player-owned businesses, including theft rules.

## Scrapyard Rules

Welcome to the Scrapyard. (Season 2's Scrapyard is on La Cour Rd, indicated on the labeled map we've provided) Help yourself to the junk inside. Scrap it, salvage it, take out your anger on it, whatever. We only ask that you donate some of your own resources in return. The more you give, the more we'll have, which means we can bring in better and more junk. We hope this will be a beneficial arrangement for all.

In the Scrapyard, there will be multiple cars of varying states of decay. THEY ARE NOT CLAIMABLE AS VEHICLES. The cars in the Scrapyard are solely for training mechanics, dismantling, and scavenging parts.

- Be Courteous! Do not dismantle every car in the lot by yourself. Let other people have a chance to get at the parts they need or train what they need.
- Use Common Sense
  > If a vehicle has many good parts, consider uninstalling them before dismantling a vehicle or not dismantling it. While there are not rules on when and when not to dismantle in the Scrapyard, this falls under the 'Be Courteous' category.

If there are questions, please reach out to staff! Staff will be checking in on the area to make sure it's being used properly. We also will be refreshing the vehicles from time to time in order to allow rotating stock of parts and inventory.
