# Season 1: Big Sky Country Rules

## Pre-Apocalypse Rules

*These rules are temporary and will be removed once there is an official announcement of when the outbreak has begun.*

### Looting

- No looting empty properties. There are implied citizens living inside those homes, and it is strictly prohibited to steal from them until after the outbreak.

### Criminal Activity

- Normal theft rules apply when stealing from safehouses. Review rule #3 before stealing from other players. üìï[server-rules](link-to-server-rules)
- Stealing from non-occupied shops that utilize ER Cards as currency is strictly prohibited.
- Stealing from player-owned businesses must be done following our theft rules.
- Mugging, Assault, Murder, etc., must utilize PvP or text-based PvP rules. Review rule #4 for more information.

### Leveling

- This pre-apocalypse period is primarily meant for roleplay. XP rates will reflect this, and out-of-character level grinding that does not suit your character's chosen profession or has been prompted organically through RP is prohibited and will be met with moderation action.
- Players found power-leveling may be subject to a 24-hour ban. Repeat offences can lead to further moderation up to and including character retirement.

### Communication

- Use the channels within the "In-Lockdown" category for in-character communication on Discord. Follow the post guidelines in each channel.

### Grace Period

- The whole pre-outbreak period counts as a grace period.
- You get one grace revive during the pre-outbreak.
- Once the outbreak starts, the 3-in-game-day grace period starts.

### Item Acquisition

- Do not loot the area.
- To acquire items such as food, meds, clothing, books, tools, etc., buy them from stores using implied roleplay currencies or trade with a player-owned business.
- Your character is not aware of the impending apocalypse. Purchase reasonably for your character's backstory.
- There are a limited amount of items that will be stocked in these stores, and this is done purposefully. More items may arrive throughout the duration of the pre-outbreak. Some items may never arrive. If you need a hammer; ask your neighbor.

### Encumbrance Based Purchasing

- You may take up to 4 encumbrance worth of items from each store in Buffalo Hill each in-game day.
- You may take up to 6 encumbrance total across all stores each in-game day.
- The exception is if there is 1 item above 4 encumbrance which will count for your whole day's worth of items.

For example:
- Oct 2nd - You bought 5 cans of food (.8 encumbrance ea) from the Food market, and 1 pair of pants (2 encumbrance) from the Clothing store. You have reached your limit.
- Oct 3rd - You bought 1 Barbeque from the Tool Store (10 encumbrance). You have reached your limit.
- Oct 4th - You bought 1 sack of flour(1) Butter (.3), Bottle of Wine (1) from the Food Market, A Cherry Spiffo from the Pawn Shop (.2), and 1 Alkagine Pack (0.5) from the Family Clinic. You have 1 encumbrance left to spend today.

### Player-owned Businesses

- Player-owned businesses can only be shopped at when the owner is online and attending their shop.
- The owner may choose to trade, imply payment transaction, or give away their items however they would like.
- Normal safehouse rules apply to player-owned businesses, including theft rules.

## Scrapyard Rules :wrench: 

Welcome to the Scrapyard. (Buffalo Hill's Scrapyard is on TBD Rd, indicated on the labeled map we've provided) Help yourself to the junk inside. Scrap it, salvage it, take out your anger on it, whatever. We only ask that you donate some of your own resources in return. The more you give, the more we'll have, which means we can bring in better and more junk. We hope this will be a beneficial arrangement for all.

In the Scrapyard, there will be multiple cars of varying states of decay. THEY ARE NOT CLAIMABLE AS VEHICLES. The cars in the Scrapyard are solely for training mechanics, dismantling, and scavenging parts.

- Be Courteous! Do not dismantle every car in the lot by yourself. Let other people have a chance to get at the parts they need or train what they need.
- Use Common Sense
  > If a vehicle has many good parts, consider uninstalling them before dismantling a vehicle or not dismantling it. While there are not rules on when and when not to dismantle in the Scrapyard, this falls under the 'Be Courteous' category.

If there are questions, please reach out to staff! Staff will be checking in on the area to make sure it's being used properly. We also will be refreshing the vehicles from time to time in order to allow rotating stock of parts and inventory.

### Pre-Claiming Vehicles, Items, Businesses and Safehouses!

If you are a verified member and would like to pre-claim a safehouse, business, items or vehicle, open a lore ticket and request one. But first; read these guidelines and stipulations for pre-claims.

-----------

> - Vehicles pre-claims are reviewed based on your character's profession, income, and the current amount of vehicles on the pre-apocalypse map. You may not qualify.
> - You may have 2 safehouses this season; 1 residential, 1 commercial. Factions are allotted their singular Faction Claim as normal.
> - Commercial claims will take lower priority over residential claims. Open a lore ticket to request either.


## For Pre-Claiming a safehouse: üè° 

- Open a lore ticket to pre-claim a safehouse.
- You may not choose a specific building, but you may request a size (small, medium, large), or type (motel, apartment, house) and Staff will find one that suits your request the best.
- You may request Staff to customize your home by either describing, or providing a max of 2 reference photos of what you'd like your base interior to look like, and staff will do their best to accommodate. You may also request Staff to do whatever they'd like with it.
- Staff will fill household items in your claim at their discretion.

## For Pre-Claiming Items: ‚òÇÔ∏è

- You may request up to 4 items. 
- Items must be placed inside a safehouse to be collected. Staff will not hunt you down in-game to give items to you. You must have a location to collect them from.
- Items must have personal reason, and not give your character an unfair advantage.
-----------
- ‚úÖÔªø  A pair of Rosemary's Jeans, an umbrella, a teddy bear, and a cat.
- ‚ùåÔªø  A sledgehammer, bullet-proof vest, a generator guide, and a crowbar.
-----------
- Season specific allowance: 1 of your 4 pre-claimed items may be a firearm that is fully loaded.
 - Guns available are; MSR788 Rifle, Double barrel Shotgun, or M625 Revolver
- If you do not want to pre-claim a safehouse (homelessness, or would like to pick your own home after exploring), but would still like 4 items, you may set a temporary safehouse claim. 
 - Open a ticket and a staff member will place your safehouse claim at a motel room nearby where you can collect your items and also remove your safehouse claim from the room.


## For Pre-Claiming a Commercial Building: üè® 

- You may request a commercial claim by stating what kind of business your character would like to run. Staff can offer some options by providing screenshots of available buildings that you may choose, or leave to staff discretion.
- It will be left to Staff's discretion what items will be in stock.
- You may request Staff to customize your business by either describing, or providing 2 reference photos of what you'd like your business's interior to look like.


## For Pre-Claiming a vehicle: üöô 
- You may request a vehicle by stating why your character would need one. 
- Staff will consider the overall amount of vehicles on the map when considering your request. You may be denied because there are too many vehicles for the pre-apocalypse zone.
- You may request a specific model, or type (heavy, sport, standard) and color. Vehicles will start with 65% condition. Please be ready with the in-game model name for your vehicle should you have one.
-----------

*Due to time constraints, Staff may not be able to customize every claim that is requested. Once the server is officially open, this service will no longer be available.*
*In the event that there are not enough business buildings to pre-claim, or there have been too many requests for the same type of business, staff may turn down requests for business pre-claims, and you may need to run your business from your original safehouse, build your own business, or share a business with someone who already owns a claim.*
*Pre-claiming is optional. There are plenty of buildings to explore, and choose for yourself once the server launches.*
