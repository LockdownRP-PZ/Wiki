## GENERAL SERVER RULES

### 1.1 No Metagaming

- Metagaming is intentionally revealing or using in-character information through out-of-character avenues.
- Metagaming includes but is not limited to:
    - Knowing a character‚Äôs name because you can see it in chat logs.
    - Knowing the location and names of characters because your previous character knew them.
    - Using/sharing screenshots (or Internet media) of in-game locations to know where to attack an opponent's base.
    - Coordinating with other players out-of-character (such as in a voice chat) to reach a certain resolution in an in-character situation.

### 1.2 No Powergaming

- Powergaming is forcing the outcome of events in a way that excludes/inhibits storytelling and atmosphere. It could be described as "playing to win" rather than honoring creative roleplay.
- Never remove another character's ability to move, speak, or otherwise have a chance to interact.
- Powergaming includes but is not limited to:
    - Declaring the outcome of an action involving another player
        - I.E. "/me reaches for Claude's machete and snatches it from her hand."
    - Complete fearlessness for your character's safety
    - Having excessive knowledge
    - Focusing on grinding skills to the detriment of RP
    - Overwhelming a player with too many consecutive actions
        - You must give players reasonable time to respond to your actions.
    - Choosing powerful starting equipment
        - The Fashionista mod enables the selection of myriad equipment at character creation, some of which is unreasonable for a brand new character.
        - For example: metal armor or an exo suit

### 1.3 No RP Evasion

- RP Evasion is deliberately avoiding (by logging out or otherwise) a roleplay situation that is unfavorable for your character/you.
- Examples:
    - Rage quitting
    - Logging out if you are caught
    - Moving away from the scene of a conflict without allowing people to respond with roleplay


### 1.4 No Random Aggression

- You cannot attempt to kill/rob someone without quality roleplay. This roleplay should include initiating conflict by either the aggressor or defender and both players agreeing to participate.
- Examples:
    - Shooting at a random people you see
    - Walking up to someone and using one line sentences such as ‚ÄúYour valuables or your life‚Äù
    - Indiscriminantly running people over with vehicles
    - Randomly causing fires
    - Using a 3-2-1 countdown and then attacking


### 1.5 Have a sense of self-preservation.

- Your character must value their life at all times and act accordingly.
- For example, if your character is in a position where they are being threatened at gunpoint, they are likely to feel fear and act carefully. They're likely to go along with the aggressor's demands or attempt to earn favor or pity. Similarly, if your character is an aggressor, they're unlikely to threaten someone inside the victim's own base while the victim's allies are close by.


### 1.6 Roleplay realistically

- Observe realistic limitations of your character and the world.
- Your character is a realistic human who must obey the laws of physics and nature.
- Examples of violating this rule:
    - Taking five knife wounds to the stomach and walking it off like it is nothing.
    - Hearing movement from behind a wall and instantly knowing that someone is there.
    - Bending a sturdy metal pipe with one's bare hands.
    - Eating five raw bags of rice in the span of an hour.


### 1.7 No Trolling/Ragebaiting

- Troll behavior, such as griefing, deliberately causing issues, provoking reactions out of character or in character, are not allowed.


### 1.8 No perverse themes

- Gore Roleplay, Explicit Torture RP, Slavery RP, Racism/Homophobia, or any other forms of perverse roleplay, is not allowed on the server.


### 1.9 Remain present on the Discord server

- To play on the game server, you must be a member of the Discord server.
- If you leave the Discord server, your character will be removed from the whitelist.
- You are not required to participate in chats on Discord.

## ROLEPLAY RULES


### 2.1 Do not break character when in-game.

- Stay in character at all times.
- If you must talk out-of-character, use the proper channels on Discord and on the server. Use /looc if you absolutely must use OOC to brief those you are roleplaying with.


### 2.2 Roleplay a character of your own design.

- You may not roleplay or reference being a real person or character from any media, from modern day or from history.
    - You may take inspiration from media, modern day or history but you cannot play as them. For example, you could take inspiration from ‚ÄúRick Grimes‚Äù from The Walking Dead (for example, by making a cop character who was separated from his family and seeks to find them), but you cannot play a character called "Nick Graves" who is fundamentally the same as Rick Grimes.
- You may not use AI writing for any part of your character's story.


### 2.3 You may have only one active character at a time.

- Players are limited to one active player character at a time.
- If your character dies or retires, you can apply for a new character.
- You may not bring back a retired character.


### 2.4 Character archetype limits.

- Certain character archetypes are subject to rigorous scrutiny. The idea of this rule is to discourage common and poorly-done character archetypes, encouraging variety and uniqueness among characters.
- Limited-archetype characters will not be accepted unless the applicant can make the character unique outside of their profession. The likelihood this type of character being accepted is low. Applicants may attempt to apply for a limited-archetype character once per season/anthology. If denied, they will be asked to submit a different character with a different background/profession on their next attempted application.
    - After playing a non-limited-archetype character, a user may apply for a limited-archetype character again.
- Limited archetypes:
    - Military (soldiers, spies, commanders)
    - Domestic Security (police, FBI, CIA)
    - Mercenary (bounty hunter, freelance security)
- These are general archetypes. Characters may fall under this rule depending on application handler discretion.


### 2.5 Use the proper channels for in-character communication.

- Discord (private or sever) messages do not count as private walkie-talkie channels unless stated otherwise.
- We have a public Discord channel for in-character public radio broadcasts. You can use it to find other characters or converse with them. There are also faction channels which registered factions can use for in-character communication on a faction-member-only radio frequency.
- Use in-game radios to communicate with other characters across distances.
    - Speak to other characters and decide on a radio frequency to use.
    - We have a mod that allows your radio to continue receiving and transmitting while inside containers or attached to your belt. Take advantage of that.


### 2.6 Do not abuse game mechanics.

- You must not use exploits or circumvent normal game mechanics to do things your character would not normally be able to do.
- Bug abuse, hacks, and other forms of game exploitation are disallowed.
- Exploitative building is disallowed.
    - Sky-houses
    - Water-surrounded "floating" buildings
    - Player traps, such as a gap in the floor obscured by tall structures
- If you are unsure about a mechanic, please raise a üìãsupport-ticket or comment in üí¨support


### 2.7 Characters must be 18 years of age or older.

- You may not play an underage character.


### 2.8 Death is the end of your character.

- If your character dies legitimately to game mechanics (falling, infection, bleeding), you are dead and will be dropped from the whitelist.
- You will have to start over with a new character. You will need to submit a whole new application.


#### 2.8.1 Grace period

- Newly created characters have a 72 in-game hour grace period.
- If you die during this time, you do not need to submit a new character.
- It is up to you to get your skills and items back; we will not restore them.
- We offer 1 revive and 3 heals during this grace period.


#### 2.8.2 Reclaiming items from a previous character

- You cannot retrieve your items from a previous character until 2 real life days have passed.
- We can‚Äôt stop you from rejoining your old faction, but you must not metagame to join the faction. You must discover it in-character.
- If your faction happened to hold onto your previous character's belongings and happened to pass it on to you, that is fine.
- The same applies to independant characters. If not within a faction, you must still wait 2 real life days before recovering your items.
- You cannot leave a will promising all your items and/or safehouse to your next character.


#### 2.8.3 Illegitimate deaths

- If you died/became infected/injured because of a glitch or rule-breaking behavior committed upon you by someone, your character will be restored to as it was prior to the incident.
- Let us know by opening a support ticket.
- You *must* provide video evidence of what happened.
    - Record your gameplay sessions using software such as NVIDIA's ShadowPlay feature, Medal, or OutPlayed.
    - Check out this announcement for more info: https://discord.com/channels/929553323613368413/929562126249500743/1120686211984535582
    - We cannot issue a revive or heal without direct video evidence of the incident.
- If you are revived or healed, you must roleplay the incident as a ‚Äúnear miss.‚Äù


### 2.8.4 Evading infection death via logout

- If your character becomes infected with the zombie infection, you are expected to play it out until they are either cured or dead.
- If you delay the infection death by staying logged out for two (2) weeks, your character will be considered dead.
- An exception can be made if you will be going on an extended hiatus. Submit a support ticket to inform staff so we can work something out.

### 2.9 Do not leave the playable area.

- Each season of Lockdown features a clearly marked playable area. Players may not leave the area unless it is for an event.
- Anyone caught sneaking out of the map to go and loot somewhere outside of it will be teleported back, and the loot will be confiscated. We check the logs often to stop such offenses.
- Violations will be met with a temporarily ban of 48 hours.
- The boundaries are marked by checkpoints and rivers. Do NOT cross them.


### 2.10 Romantic relationships are allowed, within reason.

- Marriages, courting, dating, cohabiting, etc are all acceptable forms of roleplay.
- Gender is no barrior to romantic relationships. Same-sex relationships are acceptable.
- ERP (erotic roleplay) must NOT take place on the server. We have a zero tolerance policy on this.
- Any player who is uncomfortable with a character's advances or feels another player is being inappropriate may come forward. We encourage you to submit a ticket with screenshots of the conversation. It will be handled discreetly and professionally.


### 2.11 Do not disassemble large amounts of furniture.

- This rule exists to preserve the map's aesthetic and allow players the opportunity to obtain furniture for decoration.
- You may take furniture for decoration in your own house.
- If you need wood for carpentry, it is more efficient to use an axe to chop trees and a saw to make logs into planks. Trees are also a renewable resource.
- If this rule is violated, we will remove the XP gain and you will be issued a 24 hour ban.
- Inside of your own safehouse you may do as you wish with your furniture.
- Fences are not part of this and can be deconstructed, provided they are not safehouse claims or world boundaries.


### 2.12 Do not remove lootable containers from high-value loot spots.

- Loot can respawn in world-generated containers. This rule exists to give players the opportunity to loot commonly-targeted buildings.
- High-value loot spots:
    - Gun stores / army surpluses
    - Police departments
    - Prisons
    - Pharmacies
    - Pawn shops
    - Hardware stores
    - Farm supply stores


### 2.13 Do not farm good-condition vehicles for parts, scrap, or XP.

- This rule exists to ensure that new players won't find it too difficult to obtain a usable vehicle. We want all of our players to have access to reasonable transportation.
- If a vehicle is over 35% condition, you may not salvage, dismantle, or take engine parts from it.
    - Engine parts can be crafted thanks to our modlist. Seek out skilled craftspeople (players or NPCs) for help if you have trouble getting engine parts.
- You may take individual components (aside from the engine) from a vehicle, but do not leave a vehicle with more than three (3) necessary parts missing.
    - Necessary parts include: driver's seat, gas tank, battery, tires, brakes, and suspension.
    - For example, you may take the battery and two tires. Alternatively, you may take the driver's seat, a suspension, and the gas tank.
- When training mechanics, do not ruin a vehicle's parts by attempting to remove them with low skill level.
    - At low levels, the battery, radio, head/tail lights, and tires can be removed with no chance of damage.
    - You may make attempts to remove a part beyond your skill level, but do not do so excessively.
- Violations of this rule are identified as a form of griefing and will be punished with a 24 hour ban.
- Feel free to open a support ticket and ask questions if you're in doubt.


### 2.14 World knowledge.

- If your character is a local, they may have some prior information on the world, such as factions, antagonists, and major events.
- This does not invalidate [rule 1.1 - No Metagaming](#11-no-metagaming).
- This does not allow you to know the location of your previous characters loot after their death. This is classed as Meta-gaming and will be dealt with as such.
- This does not allow you to know precise locations of bases. Your character may know the general area but not the exact location. I.E: Bob may know ‚ÄúThe Outcasts‚Äù are based in Verdict Heights, but not the exact building. You must discover this through Organic Roleplaying.
- Players are not allowed to use the :zombie:lost-to-the-hordes (LTTH) channel as in-game information.
    - Once your character has found out that a character has died (for example by finding the body or being informed by another character), then their loot is fair game.
    - The staff team may remove the claim of a dead character's property, indicating that the property is abandoned.


### 2.15 Roleplay your chosen PZ traits.

- When creating your character, pick traits that relate to your character. For example:
    - If you choose the cowardly trait, roleplay being cowardly.
    - If you choose the ADHD trait, roleplay the effects of ADHD on your character.
- You're not required to roleplay every trait you choose or to only choose traits that are part of your backstory. Keep your character in mind and choose traits that make sense.
- If you are caught with an excessive amount of traits you are not roleplaying, you will have your traits rebalanced by the moderator team and will be issued a warning.
- Creating an optimized build without regard to your written character is a breach of rule [1.1 - No Metagaming](#11-no-metagaming).


### 2.16 Skill limiter.

- To prevent overpowered builds, we have a skill limiter in place. Your starting skill level determines the maximum skill levels you will be able to reach.
- Crafting and survival skills are capped depending on your starting points:
  0 = 5; 1 = 7; 2 = 9; 3 = 10;
- Weapons skills are capped similarly, but to a lesser extent:
  0 = 7; 1 = 9; 2 = 10;
- Agility skills (sprint, sneak, nimble, lightfooted) are capped to an even lesser extent:
  0 = 9; 1 = 10


### 2.17 Character Re-Specs

- In case you find that your character isn't represented in-game the way you imagined them, we offer a courtesy re-spec (aka respec) to give you a chance to adjust them. A re-spec will allow you to remake your character, respawning with an adjusted spread of traits.
- You may request a re-spec for any reason. Common reasons for a re-spec:
    - Learning about the Skill Limiter's effect
    - Discovering that higher skill levels are needed to craft certain items (i.e. engine parts)
    - Finding out that a trait is unpleasant to deal with
- You are allowed one (1) re-spec per character.
- To take this offer, please submit a üìãsupport-ticket, stating the reason why you want to re-spec. We will help start the process. In your submission, please include a screenshot of your character's current skills. Make sure your screenshot shows your character's name and the in-game date. We will restore the skill levels to the character after you load in, assuming your new build allows for your character to reach the same levels they were at before.
- We will not award 'partial' levels in skills.


### 2.18 Close-Call Token

Players begin each season/anthology with a *"close-call token"*. Players may turn in their token to revive their character for any reason.

- The token can be used once per season/anthology, per player - meaning that if you used the token on one character, it can't be used on another during the same season/anthology.
- The token grants a revive without requiring proof of the cause of death.
- The token does not have a time limit. It can be used at any point during the season/anthology.
- Tokens do not carry over to following seasons/anthologies. You cannot save a token for use in a later season/anthology.
- Players may not gift their close call token to another player.
- The death must be roleplayed as a close call by the character - meaning your character *almost* died, but for some reason they didn't.
- The character will receive wounds compatible with the cause of death to simulate what they went through.
- If the token is used because of a PvP related death...
    - The killer and the victim must agree Out-Of-Character on the use of the token revive. The killer may veto the revive, in which case the token will not be used.
    - The victim cannot retaliate against the killer for 48 real-life hours.

To use your *close-call* token, open a üìãsupport ticket explaining that you would like to do so. Provide the following information:

- Your character's full name.
- A description of the cause of death.
- Your idea for how the close call will be roleplayed.
    - If you're struggling to come up with a close call, feel free to ask. We'll help you choose one.

## THEFT RULES

### 3.1 Offline raiding is strictly prohibited.

- If you wish to steal from a player/faction, you must check whether the occupant is online first. Check the safehouse or vehicle claim note for its member(s).

### 3.2 Do not destroy any items or architecture

- You are not permitted to destroy any items in the safehouse. This included destroying locked containers to force loot to drop.
- To gain entry and legally loot a safehouse, the safehouse must be unlocked. You are not permitted to break down a door, wall or barricade. You must find a legitimate way in.
    - An example of an illegal safehouse raiding techniques is using zombies to break down parts of a safehouse.
    - Any form of damage to a safehouse by a player will be classified as griefing and will be dealt with as such.

### 3.3 Do not steal an overwhelming amount.

- You may only steal up to 30 weight units per theft and per thief.
- Up to three affiliated thieves (each controlled by a different player) may steal items during the same theft.

### 3.4 Do not steal vehicles.

- You may steal FROM a vehicle however you cannot steal THE vehicle.

### 3.5 Do not bully a player or faction through stealing.

- You may only steal from a player or faction once in a 72 (real-life) hour period.

### 3.6 Do not steal from a player while they are at an event.

- Safehouse and vehicle claims are protected during events.
- If a player is at an event, they cannot be stolen from in any capacity.

### 3.7 Leave a clue

- When a player has stolen from another player, whether at their safehouse, their vehicle, or elsewhere, they must leave a clue behind give the victim a lead on the culprit.
- This rule exists to ensure players roleplay criminal interactions. We are a story driven server, and thefts are expected to result in roleplay.
- Clues may be done in the form of a written note and/or items.
- Leave stronger clues for larger thefts.
- Clue examples:
    - *A torn piece of leather with a Legion MC biker patch is bunched up on the floor near the crates. Some black hair dye could be seen splashed on the walls.*
    - *A lock of bright red hair has been left behind at the scene.*
    - *Mud has been tracked into the room by large military boots. From the deep prints, it‚Äôs easy to tell the boots were in a tall men‚Äôs size.*
    - *There‚Äôs a handprint in the dust on the left wall. The handprint is small and thin.*
    - *Fresh blood lines the edge of the bucket. With the right equipment, you could identify the blood type as A-.*

### 3.8 Report your theft by opening a support ticket.

- Open a support ticket and describe the theft. Include the following, using screenshots and/or text:
    - The list of items stolen
    - The list of accomplices
    - The victim(s) of the theft
    - The clue(s) left at the scene
    - A screenshot showing that the victim was online.
- These tickets are necessary to keep track of legitimate raids, bugs, and unexplained losses.
- Failing to report the raid makes it illegal. All items will be returned to the owner.
- Thefts must be reported within 1 hour of the action taking place.
- Reporting the theft is necessary even if the action is roleplayed out with the player present. The same time limit applies.

#### Example of the details to include in a theft ticket:

> Yvonne heard Davot talk about an armory at the police station over the radio and decided to rob them.

## PVP RULES

To initiate PVP, players must follow a certain procedure. We are not a PVP based server, however we are open to it as long as it suits your character's narrative. For example, a pacifist would not go around with a shotgun threatening others to incite aggression.

Keep in mind the [General Server Rules](#general-server-rules) when considering a PvP engagement.
- No Metagaming
- No Powergaming
- No RP Evasion
- No Random Aggression
- Have a sense of self-preservation
- Roleplay realistically
- No Trolling/Ragebaiting

### 4.1 No KOS (Kill On Sight) under any circumstances.

- To engage in PVP, you must first roleplay a dialogue. This can be anything from throwing insults to a bartering deal gone wrong. The situation is down to the players and how their character would react.

### 4.2 All players involved must consent to PVP prior to the fight.

- If a situation is escalating to violence, use /looc to request PvP consent.
- If you are asked for PvP consent, make your response clear using /looc by saying "I consent to PvP" or "I do not consent to PvP."
- If PvP consent is declined, the requestor must offer a different way out of the situation, such as an ultimatum.
    - For example: "Drop your weapon and go," or "Never come back here again."
    - Refusal of PvP consent does not mean the refuser must acquiesce to all requests. Keep it reasonable.
        - For example, this does not give you free reign to take a character hostage, exchange them with another, or threaten to kill the hostage unless demands are met.
- NPCs played by staff are also subject to the consent rule.
- In a PvP situation involving multiple players where not everyone consents, the non-consenting players must move away from the PvP area.
- Do not attempt to join into the middle of a PvP scenario. Project Zomboid PvP is often quick and deadly.

### 4.3 Toggle PvP on before PvP starts.

- In Project Zomboid, any character with PvP enabled on can hit or be hit by any other player, regardless of other players' PvP setting.
- All players who consent to PvP must toggle PVP on.
    - EXCEPTION: Some situations call for only one side to enable PvP to avoid friendly fire.
        - If a PvP scenario involves many players versus one, use /looc to decide that the 1 solo person will enable PvP.
        - If a group of NPCs played by staff are involved, only the staff NPCs will enable PvP. This avoids players accidentally shooting each other.

### 4.4 Explosives are disallowed in PvP.

- Explosives have a high chance of causing wide collateral damage, including non-consenting players.
- Explosives are too powerful and will not result in a fair fight.

## TEXT BASED PVP

Text based combat is allowed, provided the following rules are observed.

### 4.5 Take turns.

- Only 1 action per line of text.
- Actions cannot be chained in a single turn.
- For example, you cannot have a script written and copy and paste actions in as quick as possible. This will be counted as powergaming.

### 4.6 Do not force an outcome.

- Forcing an outcome is an example of powergaming.
- For example, "/me swings his bat, smashing Robert in the face, breaking his nose."
    - Instead of this, the attacker may make an *attempt*.
    - Here's an acceptable alternative: "/me swings his bat at Robert's face, aiming for his nose."

## ALTERNATIVE PVP RULES

### 4.7 Consent Exception: Combat Warning System

- Some areas of the map are designated "Open Combat" zones. They will be specially marked as such. Inside these zones, different PvP rules apply. Entering the area means you consent to these rules. The rule is referred to as the Combat Warning (CW) system. The goal of this system is to solidify the danger inhabiting the zone by removing the usual need for consent.
- These rule apply to NPC vs PC combat only. Players may not use this system to initiate PvP with other players.
- Open combat zones will have limited entrances. Each entrance will have clearly marked warnings about what it means to enter the area.
- Instead of consent, a threat will be issued in the form of an emote, an exclamation, or a remark, which will end with: (CW)
- The Combat Warning serves to warn players that PVP will be engaged and to choose their next move carefully. (CW) indicates that you will be attacked.
- After being given a combat warning, you will be given the chance to make one emote or statement before being open to combat.
- You may surrender or make a run for it, but doing so will not guarantee your safety.
- NPCs will provide a clear emoted combat warning prior to engaging a player-character. Examples:
    - /do The white-light glint of a faraway scope catches your eye. A trigger-happy fellow is itching to shoot. (CW)
    - /yell "Turn around NOW!" (CW)
    - /me pulls out a gun (CW)

## SAFEHOUSE AND VEHICLE CLAIMS


### 5.1 Players may claim a safehouse at any time after joining the game.

### 5.2 Players may claim one safehouse. (This may change season-to-season.)

### 5.3 Safehouses become invalid after 2 real-life weeks of inactivity.

- Exceptions may be made. If you will be away for an extended period, please submit a support ticket to present your case.

### 5.4 Mark your safehouse with a piece of paper, journal, or notepad.

- To claim a safehouse, you must place a piece of paper, journal or notepad at each entrance which is accessible to your building.
- The in-game safehouse system is disabled. It causes more problems than it solves, so we rely on these safehouse rules.
- The claim note must include the safehouse owner's character name(s).
    - Please write each owner/user of the safehouse on the note. This is to prevent any offline raiding and so we know who has access to your items when you are not online.
    - Claims using the user's Discord name are not valid.

### 5.5 Only clearly-marked-areas, buildings, rooms, and vehicles may be claimed.

- A particular container in a property cannot be claimed.
    - Claimed containers will not be subject to theft rules.
- To claim an area, wall off the area by either a fence or wall and place a claim note by each entrance (such as a gate or an empty space in the wall/fence).

### 5.6 Do not claim an unreasonably large area.

- A single player may not claim an apartment block. However, they can claim a room within it.
- A group of 3 or more can claim a full apartment block as their safehouse.

### 5.7 Players may claim two vehicles, each of a different type.

- Players may own a maximum of two (2) vehicles. Each vehicle must be of a different type.
    - Sport (muscle cars, motorcycles, etc.)
    - Standard (station wagons, taxis, jeeps, ATVs, etc.)
    - Heavy-Duty (trucks, buses, vans, etc.)
- This means you could own, for example, a semi truck and a police cruiser.
- Players may claim one (1) trailer in addition to their vehicles.
- To claim a vehicle, place a note in its glove box, in its trunk, and/or on the ground nearby.

### 5.8 Players can claim a mobile safehouse in lieu of a building/room/area.

- Thanks to the Vehicle Interiors mod, some vehicles (such as RVs and buses) have interiors that can be entered and lived in. These are known as mobile safehouses. Claiming one counts as claiming a safehouse.
- Your mobile safehouse counts as one of your vehicles. You may not claim, for example, both a bus and a truck (because they are both heavy-duty).
- Claiming a mobile safehouse is done the same as claiming a regular vehicle.

## FACTION RULES

### 6.1 To create a faction, open a support ticket to register it.

- Please provide the following details:
    - The faction name
    - The faction tag
    - A list of the members in the faction
- We may further ask you a couple more questions such as if they have a backstory (for example, a police unit, military unit or a family) and any faction goals.
- Registered factions must have a minimum of 3 players and a maximum of 8 players.
- You do not have to be living in the same safehouse to submit a faction request, only that you agree to form a faction.
- When a faction is registered, they obtain a Discord channel which functions as a private radio channel that only the faction members know of.

### 6.2 Factions may claim a faction vehicle in addition to the individual members' vehicles.

- To claim a faction vehicle, write the name of the faction and its members on the claim note.
- Your faction vehicle may be of any type (sport, standard, or heavy-duty).
- Factions may have ONE faction vehicle, regardless of faction size.

### 6.3 Notify staff of new and removed members.

- If a member joins or leaves your faction, make an out-of-character request to @Admin Team in your Discord faction channel.
    - For example: || @Admin Team Please add Jim Thornton to the faction. ||

### 6.4 Notify staff when your faction has disbanded.

- If your faction has disbanded, please let an admin know in your faction Discord channel or use a :clipboard:support-ticket.
- This is so we can keep tabs on which faction is around and if their land/structures are a valid claim.

### 6.5 Faction safehouse claims are considered invalid after 2 weeks of inactivity.

- If all players within a faction remain inactive for 2 weeks, the faction safehouse claim will be considered invalid.
   - An invalid claim is not protected by theft rules.

### 6.6 Faction wars are allowed, provided all PvP rules are followed.

### 6.7 Safehouse raiding another faction is allowed.

- If you are raiding a rival faction safehouse, normal theft rules apply. You cannot break down any of the barricades/doors.
- In a faction v faction PVP scenario, you are allowed to break down or remove player made barricades/doors.
- Each player is limited to 30 lbs of weight. You can now use up to 5 players for a faction V faction safehouse raid.
- Offline raiding is still prohibited. At least 1 member of a faction must be online to commence the safehouse raid.

### 6.8 Factions may claim a faction safehouse in addition to the individual members' safehouses

- Faction safehouses are allowed be larger than independent player safehouses.
- A faction safehouse is in addition to players' independent safehouse(s).
- Each player may have a personal claim within a faction safehouse.
    - For example, if your faction is based out of an apartment block, you may claim a room in that block.
    - A faction member's personal claim is treated separately from the faction safehouse (it may not be stolen from if the member is offline).
    - If you have a personal claim within your faction safehouse, it counts as one of your personal safehouses.

### 7.1 PvP with NPCs

- Regular PvP consent rules apply.
    - That is, consent must be gained except in Open Combat zones.
- If PvP occurs against NPCs, only staff NPCs will have PVP enabled.
    - This is to enable players to engage in PvP without accidentally injuring other players.

### 7.2 Injuries during events

- Event staff will not be held responsible for injuries caused indirectly by staff during events (E.G a spawned zombie scratching the player character).
